# Voice Cheatsheets

Reminders of commands and shortcuts I use when working and coding with my voice.

    - Talon Voice extensions: Rango, Cursorless, talon-filetree, modified_full_mouse_grid, gaze_ocr
  
Other software I use in conjunction with Talon Voice:
  - Homerow
  - lazygit - terminal GUI for git
