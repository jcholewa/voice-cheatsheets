# Voice Cheatsheets

Reminders of commands and shortcuts I use when working and coding with my voice.

Voice software I use:
  - Talon Voice
    - Talon Voice extensions: Rango, Cursorless, talon-filetree, modified_full_mouse_grid
  - Homerow (this is for keyboard shortcuts, but I trigger them with Talon)
